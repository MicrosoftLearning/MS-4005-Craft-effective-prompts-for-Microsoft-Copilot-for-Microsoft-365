## Let's get crafting

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Draft a new email._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to draft a new email._ However, there's no information about what the email will even be about, who to send it to, or what you want it to sound like.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| Basic prompt: <br>Start with a **Goal** | **_Draft a new email._** |
| Good prompt: <br>Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what the email should be about and who the audience is.<br><br>"_...to my client, Allan Deyoung, regarding the status of their support ticket._" |
| Better prompt: <br>Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot where to look for specific information.<br><br>"_...Look through my emails for latest information on ticket #1928374655._" |
| Best prompt: <br>Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the document to be written and formatted.<br><br>"_The email should sound professional and technical, but written with empathy._" |
