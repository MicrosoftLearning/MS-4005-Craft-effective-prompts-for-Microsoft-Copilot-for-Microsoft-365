Copilot can also step in to make what you have even better. Maybe you're teaching a cooking class and need some slides about making pizza, but it could use some images.  Ask Copilot to “**_Add an image of a chef making pizza dough_**” and Copilot will find the perfect image to make your slide more appealing.

Give it a try with the following prompts and see what Copilot can come up with for you.

## Let's get crafting

First, download and open **_[Mystic Spice Premium Chai Market Analysis Presentation.pptx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268768)_**. Save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so.

> [!NOTE]

>
> _Add new slides to this PowerPoint presentation._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to add new slides to a presentation_. However, there's no indication how many slides you want to add or even what topic they should cover.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Add a new slide to the PowerPoint presentation._** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what the slides are for and what topic to focus on. _"...summarizing the latest market trends for premium chai, including key consumer preferences and emerging competitors."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot know where to look for specific information. _"Use insights from the existing slides on market trends and demand."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the slide organized and written. _"Format the slide with engaging visuals and concise bullet points for key takeaways."_ |
