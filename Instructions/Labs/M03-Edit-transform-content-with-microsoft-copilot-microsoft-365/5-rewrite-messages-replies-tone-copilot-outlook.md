In the following example, we start with a simple prompt and add elements along the way. Follow along with the example after using Copilot to draft an email.

## Let's get crafting

**First, ask Copilot in Outlook to draft a fictitious email** with the following prompt:  

> _Draft a short product update announcement for customers about our latest software release. Highlight key new features, improvements, and how they benefit users._  

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Review this email and make suggestions to improve it._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to improve the email_. However, there isn't much detail about what kind of improvements are needed.  

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Make this email more formal._** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** helps Copilot understand the purpose of the email and what kind of improvements are needed. _"...so it sounds more professional and polished while maintaining a warm and engaging tone."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** for this prompt is the email you've already drafted in Outlook. _"...this email."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Adding **Expectations** helps Copilot understand the desired changes. _"Ensure the email is professional, concise, and highlights the key details of the product update clearly."_ |

> [!NOTE]  
> **Crafted prompt:**  
>
> _Make this email more formal. Ensure the email is professional, concise, and highlights the key details of the product update clearly._  

This prompt gives Copilot everything it needs to come up with a good answer, including the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations**.
