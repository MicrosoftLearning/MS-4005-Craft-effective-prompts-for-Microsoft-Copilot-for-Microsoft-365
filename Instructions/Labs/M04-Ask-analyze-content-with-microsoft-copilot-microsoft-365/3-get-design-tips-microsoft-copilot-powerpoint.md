## Let's get crafting

If you haven't done so yet, download the following files and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** so they appear in your MRU list:

- **_[Mystic Spice Premium Chai Market Analysis Presentation.pptx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268768)_**
- **_[Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea product description.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268929)_**

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Organize this PowerPoint presentation._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to organize a PowerPoint_. However, there's no information about why the presentation needs to be summarized or what the summary is needed for.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **Organize this PowerPoint presentation.** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand the way in which you want to organize the deck and the reason for doing so. _"for an executive product review next week"_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot look in a specific location, such as product specifications or a catalog. _"Refer to the **/Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea product description.docx** for product information."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how to structure the presentation and what level of detail to include. _"Arrange the slides by product and include an overview, a list of key features and benefits, customer feedback, and a comparison to similar products in the market."_ |
