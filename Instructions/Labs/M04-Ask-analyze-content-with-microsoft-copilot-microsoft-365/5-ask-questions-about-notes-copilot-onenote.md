In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to find out which webinar had the most attendees and participation_. However, you could provide even more information so Copilot can generate a useful response.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Which webinar had the most attendees and participation?_** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what you need the information for. _"...for our quarterly business review."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** for this prompt is assumed to be the notebook in OneNote, but you can get even more specific by referencing specific pages or topics. _"Please refer to the attendance data from the notes for the last quarter."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you fine-tune your results. _"Please calculate the total number of attendees and average participation rate for each webinar. Please identify the webinar with the highest attendance and participation rate and provide a brief summary of its topic and key takeaways."_ |
