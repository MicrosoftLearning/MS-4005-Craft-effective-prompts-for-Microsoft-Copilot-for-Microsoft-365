# Summarize information on a topic with Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat (Copilot Chat) combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with your work data and apps to help you unleash creativity, unlock productivity, and uplevel skills. It works across multiple apps and content, giving you the power of AI together with your secure work data. Its ability to synthesize information and create things from multiple sources at once empowers you to tackle broader goals and objectives.

To compare, Copilot in the different Microsoft 365 apps (such as Word or PowerPoint) is specifically orchestrated to help you **within that one app**. For example, Copilot in Word is designed to help you better draft, edit, and consume content. In PowerPoint, it’s there to help you create better presentations. But with Copilot Chat, we can pull that all together into a new experience.

You can access Copilot Chat in several ways:

## Let's get crafting

First, download and save the following files to your **OneDrive** folder and add them to your MRU list:

- [Contoso Chai Tea market trends 2023.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268822)

Open Copilot Chat in Microsoft Teams and follow along with the prompts that reference the files above.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Find and compile information on Contoso's new Protein Plus shake._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to summarize information about a new product._ However, there's no information about why you need the summary or what you're looking for.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **Find and compile information on Contoso's new Protein Plus shake.** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand the purpose and adjust the response accordingly. _"...for an upcoming quarterly business review. We need an executive summary, as well as details on the social media campaign and competing products."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot understand where to look for information and provide a more accurate response. _"Look for information in **/Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx**, **/Contoso Chai Tea market trends 2023.xlsx**, and **/Market Trend Report - Protein shake.docx** to write the executive summary."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how to format the summary and what level of detail is required. _"The summary should sound professional, with a hopeful tone about our release blockers. The competitive analysis should also include links to the relevant products in a table."_ |
